# How to Handle Time and Date in Python

import time

# Get current time in epoch seconds.
time.time()

# datetime.date represents a day.
from datetime import date
today = date.today()
# Value of today:
# datetime.date(2016, 7, 26) 

# Create a date object.
tomorrow = date(2016, 7, 27)
# The difference is a datetime.timedelta object.
diff = tomorrow - today

# Construct a date object from the current epoch timestamp.
# The same method can be used to initialize a datetime.datetime object.
date.fromtimestamp(time.time())

# Construct a datetime object from the current timestamp.
from datetime import datetime
datetime.fromtimestamp(time.time())

# Set the timezone.
from pytz import timezone
datetime.fromtimestamp(time.time(), timezone('US/Mountain'))

# Get the current time in UTC.
datetime.now(timezone('UTC'))
# ... And in system time.
datetime.now()
